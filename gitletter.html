		<h2 class="left translated">Dear Git,</h2>
		<p class="right box">I admire your commitment. From the <mark>first commit</mark>, the second, and the third, you always know how to save my files. You’re a great listener, and care about the details of each version I send you. It’s all about the little things with you. To styling with css, or just adding a section on html, you want to be updated and informed of my life. While I admire your dedication, you must be aware of your stalker tendencies, the way you <mark>track all changes</mark> to my directory with a simple <mark>git add .</mark> and <mark>git commit.</mark> You permanently track my files from the <mark>–m “first commit”</mark> and to the final version.  You get even creepier by requiring my personal information such as name and e-mail with <mark>commitlog</mark> and <mark>git log.</mark> But it’s okay, because you keep me organized and up to date. Just don’t ask me for my home address. You can track all of my files with <mark>git add -- </mark>or just one more file with <mark>git add second-file.html.</mark> Either way, you always care about what I have to say. <br><br>-m "Elizabeth"</p>
